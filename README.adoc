# Smart JSON Inventory

## Tips

On my development checkmk site I install pprintpp 

.install
----
pip install pprintpp
----

and use it like this to understand the data structure in python

----
from pprint import pprint as pp
...
pp(section)
...

----

INFO: once you are done with development you should remove thes pp() print statements of course.
